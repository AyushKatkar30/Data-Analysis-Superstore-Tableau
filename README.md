This project presents an interactive data visualization and storytelling analysis using the **Superstore Sales dataset**. The goal is to extract business insights by creating impactful visuals using **Tableau**, covering key aspects such as sales trends, profitability, customer segments, and operational efficiency.

## 🔍 Objective
To build a visual report that helps stakeholders:

- Understand sales and profit trends over time
- Analyze customer segments and regional performance
- Assess the impact of discounts and shipping modes on profit
